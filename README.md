For this small project, I was guided by the following tutorial:

- [Linear Regression Machine Learning (tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwwWVAgJBcM) by Siraj Raval

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle:

- [Student Performance | Clean Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/students-performance-dataset-cleaned?resource=download) by Muhammad Roshan Riaz

The dataset specifically used for this project includes the math and reading grades of students to predict performance.
